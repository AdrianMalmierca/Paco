        <h1>You probably haven't counted the number of phrases, but there are 26. As I already told you, I have a million
             reasons to love you, but for now I tell you 26. Happy 26th to one of the most important people in my life. I want to 
             thank you for all this year, as you have been a great support in this difficult process. I hope to be able to stay 
             by your side so we can celebrate more birthdays, if possible the next together 👉🏻👈🏻. Something I've had clear since 
             the day we met is that you are my best self. With you everything has become brighter and more fun, 
             you have taught me too much this year. As Gandalf said: <i>Why you? Because maybe I'm scared and you give me 
             courage</i>. Thank you for being the way you are. I am very lucky to be able to be part of your life and to be your 
             boyfriend. Enjoy your day off and your birthday, you deserve all the good things that can happen to you. 
             I love you so much.</h1>
